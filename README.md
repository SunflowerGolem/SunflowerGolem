### Hi there 👋

My name is Taisiia, and I’m a narrative designer and game screenwriter.

🥇 I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on a range of different and amazing projects throughout my career, including the popular home decor mobile game [Design Masters](https://sunflowergolem.github.io/projects/design-masters/) by Playgendary and the gripping detective story [Sunset Secrets](https://sunflowergolem.github.io/projects/sunset-secrets/) by Dou Dou Games.

🔭 Currently, I’m working on an exciting new challenge - an AAA action adventure game called [Time of the Sword](https://sunflowergolem.github.io/projects/time-of-the-sword/) with Alpha Games Studio.

✍️ Apart from my work in game development, I also enjoy writing about narrative design and game storytelling, and I'm always open to new projects!

👋 Looking for someone to design a compelling narrative or create an engaging story for your project? I’m only a message away so you can [**hire me**](https://sunflowergolem.github.io/hire-me/).
